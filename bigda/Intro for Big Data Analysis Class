Hi,

I completed undergraduate and some graduate training at Northern Caribbean University in Jamaica earning an Associate's degree in Biology, a Bachelor's degree in Medical Technology and a Master's degrees in Biology (emphasis Microbiology). I worked as a Medical Technologist for two years and then decided to pursue a PhD in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics.

My current PhD work is in the lab of Dr. Kerby Oberg studying the molecular mechanisms behind normal limb development - specifically finding a link between the FGF to SHH pathway. This work will involve analyzing data from DNA Microarray Analyses and next generation sequencing techniques. I am therefore taking this class to gain some expertise in data management and analysis. I have no formal previous training in bioinformatics though I have dabbled in IPA. I am interested in the Database Management and Statistician positions on the projects we will do in class to strengthen my knowledge in these areas.
